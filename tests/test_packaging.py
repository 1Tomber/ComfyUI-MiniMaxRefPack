"""What reaches the ComfyUI registry, and what must never be in it.

Background, 2026-08-17. 0.3.0 published and went Active. 0.3.3 and 0.3.4 published and
both sat at NodeVersionStatusPending. The only material difference in the uploaded zips
was `tests/`, and inside it `test_migration.py`, which builds a string and executes it
under node via `subprocess.run([node, "-e", script])`. That is a fine way to test shipped
JS and a textbook automated-scanner trigger, and it had no reason to be in a package a
user installs.

Two rules follow, and this file holds both:
  1. Development apparatus does not ship.
  2. The code that DOES ship contains no dynamic execution, so there is nothing for a
     scanner to find in the first place.
